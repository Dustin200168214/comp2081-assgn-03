		<h2> Time of Use Electricity Prices </h2>
		<p>Households and small businesses in Ontario pay time-of-use prices for electricity that change according to the
			<span>Time of Day</span> and <span>day of the week</span>.The peak periods also change by <span>season</span>.Your smart meter tells your utility exactly how much power you use and when you use it. With this information, your utility charges you for the amount of power you use at off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak times.</p>  
		<h3> Reasons for Different Prices</h3>
		<p><span> When Demand is Low </span> and fewer people are using power, lower-cost electricity is available from sources like nuclear and large hydroelectric systems.
		</p>
			<p><span> When demand is rises </span> during the day, the province’s supply of lower-cost electricity is used up, and more expensive sources need to be used. 
		</p>

		<!-- this section should show the circle graphs explaining peak hours -->
		<!-- STEP FOUR create this section using SVGs - the first two can be vectors, but create the last circle graph programmatically - a few hints, you can create text and curves with SVG and can also write on a curve. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial will be a big help -->
